# micrograd

My implementation of [micrograd](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd) by Andrej Karpathy.
This program creates a simple implementation of PyTorch

The purpose of this program is to gain an understanding of how a simple neural network learns by implementing backpropagation from scratch
